# Holberton Simple Shell (hsh)
Holberton Shell (hsh) is a simple command line shell. This is a culmination of everything we have learned about the C programming language thusfar.

## Getting Started
To use hsh, you can give it commands. `hsh` commands follow the following syntax: command name {arguments}.

Commands
Typing the filename in a program located in any of the directories in the [PATH] runs the command.

```
ls
```
The `ls` command lists all directories and files in the current working directory.

List of useful commands
